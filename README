Ghost Names: (byte Names[8][8])
    Ghosts with customized names on the title screen.
    How to Use:
        Set TitleType to Custom.
        Names[0/2/4/6] is the ghost's 'mood'/description and Names[1/3/5/7] is the ghost's nickname.
        Each ghost's name should be preceeded with a ". (\")
        Ghost names can only contain capital letters from the Latin Alphabet as well as any of these characters:
            !
            /
            " (\")
            -
            © (+)
        Ghost names cannot exceed 8 characters total, including any whitespace and quotation marks.
        Ghost name endings vary based on region. (see below)
        Examples:
            USA: "CHASER  ","BLINKY\" "
            JAP: "HUNTER__","_\"PINKY\""
        
Region: (USA,JAP)
    Controls a few region specific differences on the title screen.
    How to Use:
        Set Region to USA or JAP.
        For JAP, custom ghost names must be formatted so that the last character of the ghost's name lands on index 8 of its array.
        Preceeding whitespace should be underscores (_) to preserve the dashes in the background.

TitleType: (Default, Alternate, Custom, Scores)
    Controls the type of title screen displayed.
    How to Use:
        Set TitleType to one of the above values.
        Default and Alternate select between the original and alternate ghost names included on the original game.
        *Note nothing is wrong with the Alternate USA title screen, the alternate names really are "AAAAAAA", "BBBBBBB" and so on.
        If Custom is selected, you have to provide ghost names.
        If Scores is selected, player highscores are recorded at the end of each game and displayed here in place of each ghost.
